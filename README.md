# Ancient Philosophy (2/2): Aristotle and his successors

Fabio Arciniegas notes from Courseraâ€™s University of Pennsylvania Course on presocratics by Susan Sauve Meyer available at https://www.coursera.org/learn/aristotle/


# Background

Aristotle lived from 384-322. As epitomized in Raphael's painting, if Plato is looking up to the world of ideals, Aristotle is looking down towards the world and its components. Naturally this is a simplification and as we'll see Aristotle had plenty to contribute on metaphysics, logic, and ethics as well.
